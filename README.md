## Project Overview

**Awale** is a classic African strategy game. This project allows players to compete in an exciting and strategic game, manage their profiles, connect with friends, and view past games. Below youâ€™ll find instructions on how to install the game, as well as a full list of commands for interaction.

## Installation

To compile the program for the server-side, first make sure that you're in the project root and execute the command below:

```bash
cd server
make
```

Do the same thing to compile the program for the client-side, except change the directory to `client`:

```bash
cd client
make
```

To execute the program, both executables for the client and the server can be found in the `bin` directory.

For client:

```bash
./bin/client [ip_address] [username]
```

For server:

```bash
./bin/server
```

To clean and recompile the program, simply use the following command in both the `client` and `server` directories:

```bash
make clean
```
