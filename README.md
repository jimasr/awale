## Installation

### Prerequisites

To compile the program for the server-side, first make sure that you're in the project root and do the command below.

```bash
# 
cd server
make
```

Do the same thing to compile the program for the client-side except by changing the directory to client. 

```bash
# 
cd server
make
```

To execute the program, both executables for the client and the server can be found in the `bin` directory.  

For client
```bash
# 
./bin/client [ip_address] [username]

```

For server
```bash
# 
./bin/server

```

To clean the and recompile the program, simply do 
```bash
# 
make clean # To be done in both directory client and server

```
